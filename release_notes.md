# Simple String Library - Release Notes

## Version 0.4.2 (April 1, 2025)

### Overview
This release focuses on code quality improvements, better Unicode support, and enhanced documentation. The changes aim to improve compilation efficiency, provide better Unicode handling, and make the codebase more maintainable.

### Major Improvements

#### 1. Enhanced Unicode Whitespace Handling
- Fixed the String trimming methods to properly handle all Unicode whitespace characters:
  - `trim()`: Improved ASCII whitespace handling
  - `strip()`, `stripLeading()`, `stripTrailing()`: Enhanced to handle all Unicode whitespace characters
  - `isStripped()`: Updated to use consistent Unicode whitespace detection
- Added support for zero-width spaces and other special Unicode whitespace characters
- Fixed null character handling in the trim() method
- Improved the stripTrailing() method to prevent underflow issues

#### 2. Code Refactoring for Better Compilation Efficiency
- Moved String method implementations from header to cpp file, including:
  - Core methods: `length()`, `is_empty()`
  - Comparison methods: `equals()`, `compare_to()`
  - Unicode handling: `code_point_at()`, `code_point_before()`, `code_point_count()`
  - String operations: `substring()`, `get_utf16()`, `shares_data_with()`
  - Operator overloads
- This change reduces compilation time and follows better C++ practices

#### 3. Improved Unicode Support
- Enhanced the UnicodeCategory implementation with better documentation
- Moved longer methods from header to cpp file for better compilation efficiency
- Added comprehensive documentation for Unicode-related classes
- Improved code organization with forward declarations to reduce header dependencies

#### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated API documentation to reflect recent changes
- Enhanced code examples with more Unicode-related features
- Improved main README with clearer feature descriptions
- Added detailed release notes and updated changelog

### Test Improvements
- Added tests for Unicode whitespace handling edge cases
- Added tests for method chaining (e.g., `stripLeading().stripTrailing()`)
- Added tests to verify that `strip()` produces strings that are already stripped
- Enhanced identity optimization tests

### Compatibility
This release maintains full backward compatibility with version 0.4.0.

### Known Issues
None.

### Future Plans
- Further performance optimizations for large strings
- Additional Unicode normalization options
- More comprehensive benchmarking
