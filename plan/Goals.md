# Goals


As a Java developer  who needs to use C++ ... and plan to replicate Java string to C++ for most common feature. He intended to use Boost string as the underline  implementation. 

Can you consider the requirements and list top 10 -- the most important + should be implement first.
Here is the list of requirements



Java String Replication in C++ Requirements

1. Core String Operations

1.1 [X] Immutable type (like Java's String): Ensure the string is immutable, meaning once created, it cannot be modified.
1.2 [X] Creation from char arrays, C-strings, or other strings: Allow initialization from various types like const char*, std::string, and std::wstring.
1.3 [X] Concatenation using + operator: Enable efficient string concatenation via the + operator, ensuring immutability.
1.4 [X] Substring extraction: Provide a way to extract parts of the string based on indices, similar to Java’s substring().
1.5 [X] Comparison (equals, compareTo): Implement methods to compare strings for equality and lexicographical order.
1.6 [X] Case conversion (toUpperCase, toLowerCase): Support transforming the string to either uppercase or lowercase.
1.7 [X] Trimming (trim, trimStart, trimEnd): Implement methods to remove leading and/or trailing whitespace from the string.

2. Search and Manipulation

2.1 [X] Character access by index: Provide functionality to access individual characters by their index in the string.
2.2 [X] Index functions (indexOf, lastIndexOf): Implement methods for finding the first or last occurrence of a substring or character.
2.3 [X] Methods like contains, startsWith, endsWith: Implement methods to check if the string contains, starts with, or ends with a specified substring.
2.4 [X] Replace (replace, replaceAll): Enable character or substring replacement within the string.
2.5 [X] Split by delimiter, Join with delimiter: Provide methods for splitting the string based on a delimiter and joining multiple strings with a delimiter.
2.6 [X] Regular expressions support: Integrate Boost’s regex for pattern matching and substring replacement functionality.

3. Conversion Methods

3.1 [X] toString from primitives: Provide a way to convert primitive types like int, float, etc., into a string representation.
3.2 [X] valueOf from various types: Convert different types (like objects) to their string representations.
3.3 [X] getBytes for encoding/decoding: Implement methods to retrieve the byte representation of the string in different encodings.
3.4 [X] String formatting (similar to String.format()): Support for formatting strings with placeholders and variable substitution.

4. Unicode Support

4.1 [X] Full Unicode support, code point handling (like Java's codePointAt): Implement support for multi-byte characters and handling Unicode code points.
4.2 [X] UTF-16 surrogate pair handling: Ensure that characters encoded as surrogate pairs are correctly managed (particularly for code points beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane).

5. Performance Considerations

5.1 [X] Efficient memory management: Optimize memory usage to handle large strings or frequent string manipulations efficiently.
5.2 [ ] String interning: Implement string interning to avoid duplication of identical strings in memory.
5.3 [ ] StringBuilder/mutable string operations: Provide a mutable string class for efficient concatenation or modification, similar to Java’s StringBuilder/StringBuffer.

6. Integration Requirements

6.1 [ ] STL and Boost compatibility: Ensure seamless integration with standard C++ libraries like STL and Boost.
6.2 [ ] Exception handling aligned with Java's model: Implement exception handling similar to Java's approach, using exceptions for error states.
6.3 [ ] Thread safety considerations: Consider thread safety in the implementation, particularly for concurrent string manipulation scenarios.
