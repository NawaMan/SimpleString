# Task 018: Remove Boost dependency from string.hpp

## Objective
Remove direct Boost header dependencies from the `string.hpp` file while maintaining all functionality. This will allow users of the SimpleString library to compile their applications without needing Boost headers installed.

## Background
Currently, the `string.hpp` header file directly includes Boost headers (such as boost/locale.hpp), which forces users of the SimpleString library to have Boost development headers installed on their system, even though the library itself is built as a static library with Boost statically linked.

## Requirements
1. Remove all direct Boost header includes from `string.hpp`
2. Maintain all existing functionality and API compatibility
3. Use proper abstraction techniques to hide the Boost implementation details
4. Ensure all unit tests continue to pass

## Implementation Approach
1. Create appropriate abstraction layers or wrapper classes to hide Boost implementation details
2. Move Boost-specific code to implementation files (`.cpp`) where possible
3. Use the PIMPL (Pointer to Implementation) idiom or similar techniques to hide implementation details
4. Update the implementation files to maintain the same functionality
5. Ensure locale handling and string conversion operations continue to work correctly

## Acceptance Criteria
1. No Boost headers are directly included in `string.hpp`
2. All existing functionality continues to work as before
3. All unit tests pass
4. Applications using the SimpleString library can be compiled without Boost headers installed

## Dependencies
- None

## Estimated Effort
Medium to High - This task requires careful refactoring to maintain API compatibility while removing direct Boost dependencies. The string.hpp file likely has more complex dependencies on Boost than regex.hpp.

## Notes
- This is part of an effort to make the SimpleString library more self-contained and reduce external dependencies for users.
- The implementation files can still use Boost internally, but the headers exposed to users should not require Boost.
- Special attention should be paid to locale handling and string conversion operations that may rely on Boost functionality.
