# Task 019: Add LLVM IR Build Target

## Objective
Add a build target that generates LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) files for the SimpleString library and integrate it with the existing release build process. This will allow for advanced static analysis, optimization studies, and potential cross-platform compatibility improvements.

## Background
LLVM IR is a low-level intermediate representation used by the LLVM compiler infrastructure. It provides a platform-independent way to represent code that can be optimized and transformed before being compiled to machine code. Having LLVM IR output for the SimpleString library would enable more advanced analysis and optimization opportunities.

## Requirements
1. Create a new build target that generates LLVM IR files for all source files in the SimpleString library
2. Ensure the build target works with the existing build system
3. Support both debug and release configurations
4. Document the new build process in the README
5. Avoid modifying existing build targets or files
6. Integrate LLVM IR generation with the existing release build process
7. Allow LLVM IR generation to be toggled on/off during release builds

## Implementation Approach
1. Create a new CMake module for LLVM IR generation
2. Add a new build script specifically for LLVM IR generation
3. Configure the build to use Clang with appropriate flags for generating LLVM IR
4. Set up the output directory structure for the IR files
5. Ensure the build process is integrated with the existing build system without modifying core files
6. Modify the release build script to include an option for LLVM IR generation
7. Update Docker configurations to ensure Clang is available in build containers
8. Implement a mechanism to pass LLVM IR generation options through the build pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new build script (`build-llvm-ir.sh`) that generates LLVM IR files
2. LLVM IR files (`.ll`) are generated for all source files in the library
3. The build process works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL)
4. Documentation is updated to explain how to use the new build target
5. All existing functionality and build processes remain unchanged
6. The release build script includes an option to generate LLVM IR (`--with-llvm-ir`)
7. LLVM IR files are included in release packages when the option is enabled
8. The Docker-based build process successfully generates LLVM IR for all platforms

## Dependencies
- Clang compiler must be available in the build environment

## Estimated Effort
Medium - This task requires creating new build scripts and CMake modules, but does not require modifying the core library code.

## Notes
- LLVM IR files can be large, so consider compression or selective generation options
- The IR generation should be configurable for different optimization levels
- This feature will primarily be useful for developers and contributors to the library, not end users
